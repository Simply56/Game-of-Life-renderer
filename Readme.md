This wrapper around the rust Minifb crate is intended to unify the rendering method between different implementations of a Game of Life.

#### Why?
 I have been experimenting with different programming languages, libraries, data structures, and algorithms by creating different Game of Life implementations with the same rules. I wanted to compare their performance, but different rendering methods heavily impacted their performance, so I decided to unify the rendering method.
